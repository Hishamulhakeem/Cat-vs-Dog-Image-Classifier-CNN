# 🐶🐱 Pet Image Classifier using CNN

This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based image classifier that predicts whether an image is of a **Cat** or a **Dog**.

## 🚀 Features

- Built using TensorFlow and Keras
- Trained on labeled image data
- Preprocesses and resizes images to standard dimensions
- Achieves decent accuracy for binary image classification
- Includes prediction script to test on new images

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- Conv2D and MaxPooling layers
- Dropout for regularization
- Dense output with `softmax` activation
